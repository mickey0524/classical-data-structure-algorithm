# classical-data-structure-algorithm
classical data structure algorithm implemented by python such as traverse treeï¼Œsort and insert data

# Todo
  - [x] traverse tree (include recursive and nonrecursive)
  - [x] sort (insert sort, bubble sort, quick sort, binary sort, heap sort, merge sort)
  - [x] api sort (sort by calling api provided by python)
  - [x] simple dp such as largest substring sum, longest common subsequence and so on
  - [x] Union-Find algorithm
